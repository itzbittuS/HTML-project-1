       <br>
       <p>Once upon a time, a farmer had a goose that laid a golden egg every day. The farmer used to sell that egg and earn enough money to meet their family's day-to-day needs. One day, the farmer thought that if he could get more such golden eggs and make a lot of money and become a wealthy person. The farmer decided to cut the goose and remove all the golden eggs from its stomach. As soon as they killed the bird and opened the goose’s stomach, they found no eggs. The foolish farmer realized they had destroyed their last resource out of greed. 
            <br>
        <strong>Moral:</strong> Greed destroys your resource.</p>

        <br>
           <p>A shepherd boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun. One day while grazing the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but didn’t find any wolf. The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun. There is no wolf here". 
        <br><br>
            The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for many days. After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep, suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs. The boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying a lamb away!" The farmers thought the boy was playing mischief again. So, no one paid attention to him and didn’t come to his help. 
            <br><br>
            <strong>Moral:</strong> No one believes a liar even if they speak the truth once.</p>

        <br>
        <p>A pig found its way into a meadow where a shepherd was grazing a herd of sheep. The shepherd caught the pig and carried him off toward the butcher shop when it started crying loud and struggled to get free. The sheep told the pig, "The shepherd catches us regularly and drags us off like that, and we don't make any noise." The pig replied, "My case and yours are altogether different; he catches and takes you to shave off the wool, but he wants me to be killed for making the bacon."

            <strong>Moral:</strong> Don’t compare two situations without understanding them.</p>

            <marquee scrollamount="10"> <strong><mark>Conclusion:</mark></strong>
                <mark>Children from an early age should develop a strong base of moral values that help them to be good human beings. A moral story must be part of the academic curriculum and parental learning. These learning will have a profound impact on individual lives as well as on society. In the end, we suggest you read at least one new story in English with morals for your kids to teach them good moral values.</mark></marquee>
