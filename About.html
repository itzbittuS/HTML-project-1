       <p>Here are some tips for writing paragraphs:
        Topic sentence: The first sentence of a paragraph should introduce the main idea and not include details.
        <br> 
        Supporting sentences: These sentences should support the main idea of the topic sentence. 
        <br> 
        Transition sentence: This sentence should relate the ideas in the current paragraph to the next.
        <br>  Transition words like "first," "second," "next," "however," and "in addition" can be used.
        <br>  
        Length: A paragraph should have between three and ten sentences. 
        <br> 
        Flow: Paragraphs should maintain a consistent flow. </p>
